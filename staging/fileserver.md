# BioImage Suite's File Server

Applications run from the browser are only able to access a local filesystem at a fairly primitive level â€” the user must select an item to load manually and confirm that they want the browser to load it. The interface is so limited for security reasons, as if the browser could inspect the file system without any check, it would be trivial for a malicious script to download private files and send them to an arbitrary destination. 

This restriction would be particularly onerous when running image processing pipelines that require saving and loading dozens of images at each step: the user would need to accept the request for each file manually and drag it into the application. The BioImage Suite file server is designed to circumvent this limitation by uploading and downloading data from the server through a trusted link. 

The server itself is a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) process that you must connect and authenticate with before the server will accept data. We will cover how to run the server and configure BioImage Suite to use it as its source in the sections below.


## Running the File Server

The File Server comes packaged with the rest of the BioImage Suite code, which you may clone from [this link](https://github.com/bioimagesuiteweb/bisweb) if you haven't already. Once you have the File Server code open a terminal window and enter the following:

    cd ~/<NAME OF FOLDER CONTAINING BIOIMAGE SUITE>/bisweb/js/bin
    node bisfileserver.js <OPTIONS> &

The first command will change the directory currently open in the terminal to the directory that contains the File Server starter process. The second command will start the process and set it to run in the background of your terminal (see [Closing the File Server](#closing-the-file-server) for info on how to terminate the server process).

Note that the folder that contains BioImage Suite may not neccesarily be in your root directory. In that case substitute whatever location may be appropriate. 

The options for the file server are as follows:

Flag | Description | 
-|-
 -p, --port <port_number> | Which port the server will listen on. This will be the number that follows the colon in the hostname when connecting to the server.
 --readonly | If this flag is specified, the server will not accept requests to write files. 
--insecure | If this flag is set, the server will not ask for a One-Time Password when you connect. As the name suggests, setting this flag may undermine the security of the files on your system, __use with care__.
--verbose | Prints more detailed information from the server while it's running. 
--ipaddr <host_name> | Which host to connect to. Note that BioImage Suite may not support hosts besides 'localhost', i.e. your own computer. If this is not specified, the host name will be set to 'localhost'.
--tmpdir <directory_name> | Which temporary directory to use, i.e. where the server will default to saving. 
--config <file_name> | Whether the script that starts the BioImage Suite file server should read from a config file that may specify many options on the command line. This is helpful if you have a complex ipaddr, tmpdir, etc.
--createconfig | Takes the options currently written on the command line, saves them in a file, then exits. For example, you might create a config file that will run in insecure mode by writing `node bisfileserver.js --insecure --createconfig`.
-h, --help | Prints the help file for the file server.

Once you have started the File Server with a satisfactory configuration, you are ready to connect from the web.

## Connecting to the File Server

[Open BioImage Suite](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/unstableapp/) to the viewer of your choice. 

The first step is to select the File Server from the file source menu. You may change this setting by going to `Help` -> `Set File Source` and selecting BioImage Suite File Server Helper.

_Figure 2: The file source menu with the File Server item highlighted._ 


Once this is done, open the `File` menu and select any load or save option. You will then be prompted with a connect screen containing a hostname and password field. Enter the hostname and port number (hostname then a colon then the port number) and the password printed to the console to connect.

Once you've logged in to the server you will be presented with the root directories of your local filesystem. The figure below breaks down all the elements of this complex dialog:

_Figure 4: The dialog that will appear when loading or saving files to the file server._ 


A. The file path. `[Root]` indicates that you are looking at the base     folder of the file system; this path will expand as you continue to navigate in the file browser (see Figure 5).

B. The bookmarks window. Folders that are used for I/O commonly can be saved here and navigated to quickly.

C. The file browser. Click on folders to open them and files to select them. 

D. The current filename. Selected files will have their name displayed in this box. While saving a file, you type your desired file name here. 

E. The file filter selector. Only files of the selected type, i.e. that end in a given file extension, will be displayed. 

F. The close and load buttons. These will close the modal or load the selected image to the viewer. If this was a save and not a load modal, the load button would be replaced by a save button.

_Figure 5: The dialog after clicking a few directories. Note the expanded filepath and bookmarks._ 

After clicking around a little the File Server dialog should look more like this. You can go back to the root directory by clicking `[Root]` on the top-left, or any other directory in the path of your currently expanded directory by clicking its name.

## Closing the File Server

Once you are done with file operations it's good to terminate the server. Leaving connections open carries [serious security risks](https://superuser.com/questions/82488/why-is-it-bad-to-have-open-ports), and we can't promise that the server is completely secure. Luckily, terminating the server is simple, simply enter the following in the terminal window you opened the server in: 

    jobs 
    kill %<JOB NUMBER>

When you type jobs you will be presented a list of processes that have been opened in the terminal, similar to the figure below:

![](./FileserverImages/FileserverJobList.png)
_Figure 6: An example of a job list that might appear in your terminal window. In this case the job number would be 2._
